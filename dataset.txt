This project uses a modified version of the Fetal Ultrasound Brain Dataset, originally available on Kaggle.

** Original Dataset **

To improve model performance, I manually filtered and selected 1,647 high-quality images that are better suited for training.

The refined dataset is organized into three subsets:
